dmDateTimePickerPlugin is missing add on for Diem. It provides you with date, time and datetime picker for the mentioned fields.

Where can be used?
---------------
It is mentioned to be used for the admin part of the application, but since it contains widgets, it is fully compatible for front part of the application.

How to use it?
---------
In your schema.yml add "extra" for the following field types:
 - date => datepicker
 - time => timepicker
 - timestamp => datetimepicker
for the admin.

For the front application, use provided widgets, and that's all

How does it works?
---------
Simple, hides symfony select fields, adds text box and javascript that manages hidden fields values. Simple, huh?

What is different?
---------
Everything! The concept is different - javascript is just a presentation of Symfony DateTime, we do not touch that, we are just presenting a new UI. 

Localization?
---------
Of course! Automated!

To whom to say thanks?
---------
To TheCelavi :)
And this guy too: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
Note: he had a bug in his code, I have fixed it and reported to him, I do not know if he going to implemented it. 

And you are most welcome!

TODO?
---------
Format date? Is it required at all? Report if you need it, I will implement it.
